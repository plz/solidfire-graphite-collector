The script is called from the command line using the parameters shown below.  
You can run multiple instances of the script in parallel if you have more than one 
cluster to monitor.


    usage: python solidfire_graphite_collector.py [-h] [-s SOLIDFIRE] [-u USERNAME]
                 [-p PASSWORD] [-g GRAPHITE] [-t PORT] [-m METRICROOT] [-l LOGFILE] [-d debuglevel]

      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

      -s SOLIDFIRE, --solidfire SOLIDFIRE
                        hostname of SolidFire array from which metrics should
                        be collected

      -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        username for SolidFire array.  default admin

      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD   
                        password for SolidFire array.  default password

      -g GRAPHITE, --graphite GRAPHITE
                        hostname of Graphite server to send to.  default localhost

      -t PORT, --port PORT  port to send message to.  default 2003

      -m METRICROOT, --metricroot METRICROOT  port to send message to.  default netapp.solidfire.cluster

      -l LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE  if defined, execution will be logged to this file.

      -d DEBUGLEVEL To Manipulate Logging Level setting.



To have it automatically startup on server boot, make use of an rc.d script (or upstart) 
as appropriate for your OS version.   

To stop this script, simply kill the process.  A sample command to do so is shown below:

    ps -ef | grep solidfire_graphite_collector.py | grep -v grep | awk {'print $2'} \
    | xargs kill
